# Frontend-3-Week-1-May-24-Project

Project Goals
Create the UI as shown in the diagram.
Edit the DOM elements accordingly.
On click of the increment button, increment the innerhtml of the middle div by 1 and on click of decrement, decrement by 1
On clicking clear, set the inner html of middle div to 0 and set this button to display.none if count = 0
If count >1 then set the style for this button to block.
If count=0, do not let the person decrement, show an error with red color as shown in the UI. The error should not be visible otherwise.
